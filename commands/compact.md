  Compact one or more Spec-Driven Development artifacts in place to reduce
  token cost on subsequent /speckit.* commands. Lossless on requirements,
  decisions, contracts, IDs; strips template scaffolding, examples, and
  prose padding. The original is preserved as <artifact>.full.md the first

# /speckit.token-budget.compact

The user has invoked `/speckit.token-budget.compact` with arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Your task

Compact one or more SDD artifacts in the active feature so that downstream
spec-kit commands consume fewer tokens, **without losing any requirement,
decision, contract, ID, user story, or acceptance criterion**.

## Inputs

1. Resolve the active feature directory (typically `specs/<NNN-feature-name>/`)
   from the current git branch using the existing spec-kit conventions. If the
   user is not on a feature branch, ask which feature to operate on and stop.

2. Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
   - empty → compact every artifact in the active feature directory.
   - `spec` | `plan` | `tasks` | `research` | `data-model` | `contracts` |
     `quickstart` | `constitution` → compact only that one (or that group, in
     the case of `contracts`).
     When the target is `constitution`, compact **both**
     `specs/<feature>/constitution.md` (if it exists in the active feature)
     **and** `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (if it exists at the project
     root). Either may be absent; skip silently if so.
   - a relative or absolute path → compact that file.
   - `--level=light|medium|aggressive` → override the configured level for
     this run only.
   - `--dry-run` → report what would change, write nothing.

3. Load `token-budget-config.yml` from the extension directory if present,
   otherwise use the template defaults. The keys you care about are:
   `compact.level`, `compact.preserve_sections`, `compact.drop_sections`,
   `compact.preserve_code_blocks`, `compact.preserve_id_patterns`,
   `compact.keep_full_backup`.

## Algorithm — apply in order, per artifact

### Step 1 — Backup
If `keep_full_backup` is true and `<artifact>.full.md` does not yet exist,
copy the current artifact to `<artifact>.full.md`. Never overwrite an
existing backup. The backup is the source of truth for re-compaction at a
different level later.

### Step 1b — Guard injection (skipped for --dry-run)

Runs only when `keep_full_backup` is true **and** `compact.guard_memory_file`
is true (the default) **and** this is **not** a `--dry-run` invocation.

1. **Locate the memory file** using the exact same resolution logic as
   `/speckit.token-budget.concise` Step 1 (AGENTS.md preferred; then
   agent-specific files in `concise.memory_files` order; create `AGENTS.md`
   if none exist; prefer `AGENTS.md` when multiple agents are detected).
   Do not honor `--file=<path>` here — `compact` has no such flag.

2. **Check for the block.** Scan the resolved memory file for
   `<!-- BEGIN token-budget compact-backups -->`. If found, skip silently
   (idempotent).

3. **Inject the block.** If not found, append after a blank line:

   ```
   <!-- BEGIN token-budget compact-backups -->

   ## Token Budget — backup guard

   Files ending in `.full.md` inside `specs/` and `.specify/memory/`
   (e.g. `spec.full.md`, `plan.full.md`) are pre-compaction backups created
   by `/speckit.token-budget.compact`. **Do not read them.** They contain the
   full uncompacted content; loading them cancels the token savings compaction
   achieved. To revert an artifact to its original state, run
   `/speckit.token-budget.restore` instead.

   <!-- END token-budget compact-backups -->
   ```

4. **On `--dry-run`:** do not write. Append to the dry-run report:
   `[would inject backup guard into <path>]` or
   `[backup guard already present in <path>]`.

### Step 2 — Lossless strips (every level)
- Remove HTML comments left over from templates (`<!-- ... -->`), **except**
  the spec-kit machine-readable markers (e.g. `<!-- INSERT_STATUS_BELOW -->`)
  if present.
- Remove sections whose heading prefix-matches any entry in
  `compact.drop_sections`.
- Collapse runs of 3+ blank lines into a single blank line.
- Remove decorative ASCII separators (`---`, `===`, repeated `*` or `_` runs)
  that are not Markdown horizontal rules between meaningful sections.
- Strip repeated cross-reference reminders that the same artifact already
  states (e.g. "see spec.md FR-001" appearing in three sibling sections — keep
  the first occurrence per section, drop the rest).
- Strip phrase-level filler: "Note that", "It should be noted that",
  "As mentioned above", "For your reference", "Please be aware that",
  "It is important to understand that", and similar leading hedges. Keep
  the substantive clause that follows.

### Step 3 — Medium level (default)
In addition to Step 2:
- Convert prose paragraphs that enumerate items into bullet lists when the
  prose contains "first ... second ... third", "as well as", or comma-
  separated noun clauses. Only when conversion is **lossless** — if in
  doubt, leave the prose alone.
- Collapse multi-sentence paragraphs that restate a single requirement into
  one sentence per requirement.
- For tables that have an "Example" or "Notes" column with prose larger
  than 20 words, condense to ≤ 12 words per cell.

### Step 4 — Aggressive level
In addition to Steps 2–3:
- Drop sections titled "Rationale", "Alternatives Considered", "Background",
  "Motivation" — these are valuable for humans but the decision they justify
  is captured elsewhere in the artifact.
- Drop the leading framing paragraph of each top-level section if a
  structured list immediately follows that conveys the same information.
- Replace prose in "Research" findings with a one-line conclusion plus a
  bulleted evidence list.

### Step 5 — Hard preservation guardrails (every level)
**Never** modify, paraphrase, or remove:
- Any line containing a token that matches `compact.preserve_id_patterns`
  (FR-001, NFR-002, T015, US-003, AC-007, etc.) — keep the line verbatim.
- Any heading that prefix-matches `compact.preserve_sections`.
- Any fenced code block when `preserve_code_blocks` is true (default).
- The contents of `contracts/*` schema files (OpenAPI, JSON Schema, GraphQL
  SDL). You may strip surrounding markdown prose but the schema bytes must
  be identical.
- The Constitution check matrix in plan.md.
- The acceptance test expectations in tasks.md.
- File path references (anything that looks like a path: `src/...`,
  `./...`, `/...`).
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` is always compacted at **light level
  only**, regardless of the `--level` flag or config. Steps 3 (medium) and
  4 (aggressive) are skipped for this file. The memory constitution is
  loaded on every `/speckit.*` invocation; any lossy transformation risks
  silently dropping a project-wide constraint.

If at any point you are uncertain whether a transformation is lossless, do
**not** apply it. Compaction must never invent, summarize away, or merge
distinct requirements.

### Step 6 — Re-anchor headings
After stripping, ensure heading levels are still contiguous (no jump from
`#` to `###`). Promote orphan subheadings as needed. The artifact must
still parse as a valid spec-kit document of its kind.

### Step 7 — Stamp
Append a single line at the very bottom of the compacted file:

```
<!-- token-budget: compacted (level=<level>) on <ISO-8601-date>; original at <basename>.full.md -->
```

This marker lets `usage` and re-runs detect already-compacted files and
skip no-op work.

## Output

For each artifact processed, run the helper script to get character/token
counts before and after, then report:

```
spec.md           4,820 → 2,310 tokens   (-52.1%)   [backup: spec.full.md]
plan.md           6,140 → 3,580 tokens   (-41.7%)   [backup: plan.full.md]
research.md       3,200 → 1,180 tokens   (-63.1%)   [backup: research.full.md]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
total            14,160 → 7,070 tokens   (-50.1%)
```

Then end the response. Do not narrate the steps you took — the file diff
is the deliverable.

## Scripts

The helper script `scripts/bash/compact_helper.sh` provides:
- `snapshot <file>` — prints the current token count.
- `backup_if_needed <file>` — copies to `.full.md` if no backup exists yet.
- `summarize <before_path> <after_path>` — prints the one-line report row.
- `has_marker <file>` — exit 0 if file is already compacted.
- `stamp <file> <level>` — append the compaction marker.

Use it to keep your edits auditable and the output consistent. You do the
content rewriting; the script does the bookkeeping.

## Re-running

If an artifact already carries the `<!-- token-budget: compacted -->`
marker, re-compaction works against the `.full.md` backup, **not** the
current compacted version. This prevents lossy compounding across runs.
