# /speckit.token-budget.usage

The user has invoked `/speckit.token-budget.usage` with arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Your task

Inspect the active feature directory and produce a one-screen token-usage
dashboard. Read-only — never modify artifacts.

## Algorithm

### Step 1 — Resolve scope
Default scope: the active feature (from current git branch). If
`$ARGUMENTS` contains `--all`, walk every feature under `specs/`. If it
contains `--feature=<name>`, target that feature.

### Step 2 — Enumerate artifacts
For each artifact present, record:
- path (relative to feature directory)
- byte size
- estimated token count (use `estimate_tokens.sh`)
- whether a `.full.md` backup exists, and its token count if so
- whether the file carries the `<!-- token-budget: compacted -->` marker

Standard artifact set: `constitution.md`, `spec.md`, `plan.md`,
`research.md`, `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`, `tasks.md`, every file
in `contracts/`, plus any extra `.md` files in the feature root (treat
as auxiliary).

Also check `.specify/memory/constitution.md` at the project root. If
present, record it separately as a **global artifact** — it is not
feature-scoped but is loaded on every `/speckit.*` command.

### Step 3 — Project per-phase budgets
For each upcoming phase the feature has not yet completed, sum the
artifacts it would normally consume (from `scope.phase_inputs` in
`token-budget-config.yml`). Show two numbers per phase: current size,
and size if every artifact were compacted (estimated as 60% for medium,
45% for aggressive — these are heuristics, not guarantees, and should
be labeled as such).

### Step 4 — Render
Output exactly this layout. Right-align numbers. Use thousands
separators. Pad with spaces, not tabs.

```
Token Budget — feature: <feature-name>
Path: specs/<feature-name>/

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Projected phase budgets
                       current    if aggressive compact
plan       (done)            —                       —
tasks      (done)            —                       —
implement                12,560                   ~7,540
analyze                  10,100                   ~6,060

Backups present: spec.full.md, plan.full.md, research.full.md
Concise mode: <on|off>  (memory file: <path>)
```

If `--all` was passed, repeat the artifact table once per feature and
add a final cross-feature roll-up showing the total savings.

### Step 5 — Recommendations (only when warranted)
If any single artifact exceeds 5,000 tokens **and** is not compacted,
append a one-line nudge:

```
Suggestion: tasks.md is 6,140 tokens. /speckit.token-budget.compact tasks
would likely save ~40%.
```

If concise mode is off and the project is large (more than 12k total
tokens), suggest:

```
Suggestion: /speckit.token-budget.concise on  (estimated 5–15% output savings)
```

Only emit suggestions that are actually warranted by the numbers. No
generic advice.

End the response. The dashboard is the deliverable.
